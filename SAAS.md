# Third Party Services

VPDB uses a couple of services.

## Sqreen

[Sqreen](https://www.sqreen.io) provides several security-related features.  
You can enable Sqreen by setting the `SQREEN_ENABLED` environment variable to 
something truthy. Other configurations such as `SQREEN_TOKEN` are documented
[here](https://docs.sqreen.io/sqreen-for-nodejs/nodejs-agent-installation/).
