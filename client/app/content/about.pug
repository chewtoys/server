		p Virtual Pinball is a hobby many people share. VPDB is an attempt to make life easier for everybody in this great community, for contributors as well as consumers.

		p We've coded this up from scratch in our spare time and offer it as a free platform. The code is open source, that means everybody can install VPDB in their own environment and tinker with it. We also offer a public and documented API, giving access to our database to any third party application you might come up with.

		p The reason we've done this because we believe that innovation comes from providing openly the tools necessary so they can be improved and live on. In a vibrant community like this, where people provide hard and beautiful work at no cost, we think this is specially important.
