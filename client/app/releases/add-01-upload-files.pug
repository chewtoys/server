	p Note that files of a release are structured, i.e. there are only certain file types allowed:
	ul
		li <code>.vpt</code> / <code>.vpx</code> - The table file of the release. You can upload multiple of those
			| if you have multiple flavors ready to release (see step {{ step.flavors }} below)
		li <code>.vbs</code> - Table scripts, located in the <i>Scripts</i> folder
		li <code>.mp3</code> - External game music, located in the <i>Music</i> folder
		li <code>.zip</code> / <code>.rar</code> - When downloading the release as an archive, these will be
			| extracted into the <i>Tables</i> folder before adding them to the archive. However, if files
			| in your .zip or .rar file are located at the root of the archive, they will be extracted into
			| a folder named after the your .zip or .rar file.
		li <code>.txt</code> / <code>.md</code> - Note that your release will be in any case packaged with a
			| README file generated from the description you provide below. There will also be a file about
			| authors and acknowledgements distributed with every download. Thus, it is recommended to use text
			| files only for configuration or other technical usages when necessary.
