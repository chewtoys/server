The spinner had already been used in French pinball machines, such as Rally's 1967 'Playboy'.Pictured in this listing is a backglass with no color silkscreening, just black ink on clear glass. The artwork is different than the production backglass art. We asked former Williams employee Duncan Brown to identify and explain this item. He replies:That's a \"keyline\" version of the glass.  For both glasses and playfields I've seen keylines done (sometimes on the wood or glass, sometimes just on a large sheet of mylar or paper).  It's a cheap and easy early check method for the art.  For instance, in the case of a backglass, it is used to make sure that all the score display holes line up properly, before going to all the extra work of cutting the color screens and printing the glass.  If you look at any playfield or backglass, you can see that there's always a keyline layer (first one printed on a glass, last one printed on a playfield) that traps the separate colors, gives some edge definition to the art near blank areas, contains the text messages, etc.  That pencil sketch of the Vagabond backglass I sent you is essentially a keyline.  I'm kind of surprised that one that old lasted all these years.  By and large they were something to be used during the design process and then discarded.  Interesting too that the art completely changed!  I guess that's another reason for a keyline - to make sure that The Powers That Be like the direction the art is headed..."

One earlier form of \"auto-flipping\" appears on Williams' 1953 'Palisades'.This game broke all previous sales records for flipper games. Designer Pat Lawlor wanted to commemorate the actual record-breaking game from the production line and arranged to have it made in a gold cabinet. This change caused a number of games made subsequent in this original run to also have gold cabinets. At least their lower cabinets were gold, even if their backboxes were still made in blue. Included in this listing are pictures of one such example of this \"Later Production\" version having the mixed gold and blue. The legs, metal trim, and lockdown bar are not gold.Then, in 1994, The Addams Family was put back in production with a special run of 'Gold Edition' machines to further commemorate this machine becoming the best selling flipper game of all time.  These machines had many more Gold accents, such as the metal ramps, gold legs and bolts, gold lettering, the vault plastic, the bumper caps and Thing's box. Each \"Gold\" machine includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team and a gold plate on the lower right front of the machine containing the machine number.Larry Demar talks about how Later Production games could exist with mixed gold and blue cabinet art:The way our line worked, the cabinets and backboxes were created separately then joined later and this created a logistical problem for keeping gold with gold and blue with blue along with the likelihood that we had more spoilage in backboxes than cabinets (or the other way around) meant that a small number of games were mis-matched.Pat Lawlor comments further on these Later Production games:The record breaking game was #20,232. That game is the one we all had our picture taken in front of, and then on the cover of Replay. The inside of the game was signed by every worker on the line that day, and is in the possession of Gene Cunningham.Larry, you are correct that the final few games were made with the Gold. That's because you do not just make 1 cabinet when you are doing screen print production, you make many. Once the change was made, they just kept making them. Yes, there are mis-matched cabinets out there, probably orphans on the \"hospital\" line at the factory. That's the area where games with problems were kept until the techs could get around to fixing them for shipment. Another possibility is that Odd parts were sometimes assembled to get the last few games of any run out the door.Pictured in this listing is a plastic for the bookcase having text that is not seen on production games. Pat Lawlor explains why:The art for the plastics had to be approved and sent for production 3 weeks before prototype games were built. During early play testing we noticed that people could not figure out how to open the vault. So we changed the art for later plastics, but in order to use the ones already in house we put the sticker on them. It happened all the time with changes from testing to production. It was a normal part of the business.",

		"notes": "The original version of this game, Midway's 1992 'The Addams Family', broke previous sales records for any flipper pinball game. This Special Edition commemorates that event.Like the original, this edition has a flipper that not only is controlled by the player's flipper button but also is caused by the game programming to flip at certain points in game play. One earlier form of \"auto-flipping\" appears on Williams' 1953 'Palisades'.This edition has Gold accents, such as the metal ramps, gold legs and bolts, gold lettering, the vault plastic, the bumper caps and Thing's box. Each of the (only) 1000 \"Gold\" machines includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team and a gold plate, containing the machine number, on the lower right front of the machine.Machine #1 is property of Pat Lawlor himself. (see more information on Pat Lawlor and The Addams Family at http://www.patlawlordesign.com/playmeter.htm)We asked Pat if any playfields from the original 1992 run were used for this Special Edition. He replies:It's POSSIBLE that there were a few old playfields used for GOLD. But unlikely. Here's why. What many people will find unbelievable is that, at the end of the regular run of Addams Family, the remaining playfields that were not designated for parts sales were destroyed. Crushed in a large compactor. I personally saw racks of playfields go to the crusher. That's because Williams never ran second releases later. And that inventory would have had to have been stored somewhere in the building. It was more cost effective to write down the inventory than keep it. When the decision was made to do the Gold Run of 1000 games, new playfields were ordered and used. My game has a playfield made by Lenc-Smith [Manufacturing Company] in March of the build year. Impossible for the regular run! Now maybe a game was repaired with an old playfield from parts sales, but I do not believe that you could make a case that the entire run of Golds was old playfields. (My game proves that is incorrect).Larry DeMar points out that the Gold  playfield is indeed different:The PMS values for several of the colors were changed to make them \"hotter\".  Side by side, it is easy to tell apart playfields from the original run from the new run which used the same screens with different colors.",

Towards the end of the run of Flash, I asked Jack Mittel then-VP of sales why we wouldn't try to push past the 20,000 unit mark. He replied, \"We want to leave the market wanting.\"  [Steve refers to Gorgar here:] \"Gor's brother Al\" is what we used to call Algar.  The Gar family kind of died after that. I don't remember BK as having anything to do with Algar's failure. BK was a narrow body and built on a different line than Algar. Algar didn't earn money. I think Al was just a dud of a game.In The Pinball Compendium 1970-1981, designer Claude Fernandez stated he left Williams for Bally while this game was at the whitewood stage and the project was then passed to Tony Kraemer.

These changes were apparently made after production started, and a second manual with the same blue cover was issued for those games. This time, the notation GAME #689A is printed on the cover, and an Addendum page titled (Game #689A) lists the changes, pointing out the Game Prom is now 689A.

On this game, these covered lights are numbered in pairs and all are illuminated at start of game. Hitting one light of a numbered pair causes both of them to go out. When all numbered lights have been turned off in this way, the next letter in ARIZONA lites up on both the playfield and backglass, and all numbers light up again.

		"notes": "Same playfield layout as Gottlieb's 1971 'Lawman' but without the free ball gate, bonus ladder, and other inserts.Designer Jeff Brenner left Gottlieb before this game was produced, and he was unaware that any examples were made having the half-circle replay unit until we contacted him about it. He shares with us other information about this game: I designed this game at the request of Wayne Neyens and Judd Weinberg, who wanted me to design a single-player version of Sheriff.  The playfield design was basically Eddie Krynski's Sheriff / Lawman. I removed the \"paper clip\" free ball gate.  The game also featured the newer style mini-posts which had much more bounce than their predecessors used on Sheriff.  Wayne Neyens introduced two changes to the right return lane.  He placed a pin above the flipper to help block balls from rolling up the lane and draining on the right.  He also extended the playfield plastic to its weird shape to help stop balls from lofting over the return lane wireform and draining.  Apparently he felt that the left side not having a return lane handicapped the player enough.  I designed the ruleset for Atlantis in its entirety.  When I designed it, I had the top three advance lights moving from right to left.  When the production schematic designer / draftsman, Robert Moravec, redid the circuit schematic, he reversed the lane light direction to left to right.  I asked to have it changed back to right to left, but it remained as left to right when it went into production.  Noteworthy on this game was my concept of awarding a scoring premium for hitting two adjacent drop targets simultaneously.  I always had wished it had been used again, as it was very rewarding to the player, whenever it occurred.  To emphasize the feature, I wanted it produced with bullseye circles which spanned each pair of adjacent targets as I had done on the whitewood original prototype, but Judd Weinberg decided that the blue and white fish design fit the theme of the game better so they went with that.  I have read the comments of some of the other players on IPDB as well as players I talked to on location, and all agreed that this was a rewarding feature.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number 01110 and which has the half-circle replay unit and green bumper caps that are found on the game in the manufacturer's flyer. It does not have the extended right slingshot plastic as found in games made later in the production run. We do not have a picture of the lower cabinet serial number to know if it had the \"S\" suffix to signify a Sample game."

A resurgence of pinball brought Game Plan back into making pinballs and in 1984 this game was finally produced. However, John was with Gottlieb by this time and still possessed his artwork, so new art was done for the game, although John's playfield layout was still used. He has provided for this listing some film photographs of his 1981 art.Artist Larry Blazek told us that he did the (new) art for the playfield and plastics, and Tom Smeltzer did the art for the backglass."

		"notes": "A rotating handle on the front of the cabinet allows the player to pivot a small section of the playfield side wall, the \"rubber banking cushion\", to adjust the angle in which the ball leaving the shooter lane enters the playfield. This pivoting flange can be positioned to be flush with the side wall, or perpendicular to it, or at any angle in between. It takes many rotations of the handle to adjust the angle, thus it would be something done prior to shooting the ball into play and not while the ball was in motion. The propelled ball will bank against the flange, hopefully towards the desired score hole area. Four of the score holes have rubber housings around their upper side such that balls can only fall into them if rebounding from below, a difficult feat on this flipperless game. A ball falling through any hole will roll down the drain board over any or all of five rollovers. The score reel advances 200 points for each rollover. The red post at the bottom of the playfield is stationary and scores no points when hit. Balls draining below it score no points.The score reel mechanism has two dummy zeroes in its display. It also contains a rubber wheel of embossed score values and an inkpad. When a new game is started, the previous game�s score is recorded in ink on a paper tape reel. The tape, which is not reusable, slowly unspools over the course of many games into a storage compartment provided for it. This tape allows the operator and the location to agree on what final scores were obtained and, because payouts were paid by the location, this feature was advertised by the manufacturer as a solution to any disputes regarding collections.Reportedly, this game has an electric tilt mechanism. When activated, the top part, visible to the player, shows the word \"TILTED\". Its internal mechanism is boxed in, apparently inaccessible to even the operator. We asked a game owner how this mechanism detects a tilt violation and how it resets, and his reply says it best:I, and others, cannot see how the tilt works. There is a rod that goes from the readable tilt down through a hole in the bottom of the inside of the front door. This space is not accessible anywhere that anybody can see. Not from the top, side or even under the game. No access screws. Nothing. The hole the rod goes through is the same size as the rod, preventing it from moving side to side like a conventional pendulum tilt. Your guess is as good as any. It is electric, but the wires are not attached. The top part of the tilt is reset by the coin slide being pushed in.The playfields for Autobank, Autocount, and Autowhirl used the same cabinet and were interchangeable. The operator could buy another playfield to fit in his existing cabinet."

One manufacturer ad included in the price a choice of a metal stand or wooden legs, for a total height of 36 1/4 inches. One of the games pictured here measured 23 1/2 inches square and 9 inches high. Both the wooden legs and metal stand attach to the cabinet with screws.",
		"notes": "The playfield on this game is saucer-shaped and the shutter panel that keeps the trapped balls from falling through (aka baffle board) is also saucer-shaped but with its holes slightly offset. When the player pushes the coin chute to deposit a new coin, this curved shutter does not move back and forth like those on games with flat playfields, but instead slightly rotates on a central axis, aligning its holes with the playfield holes so that the trapped balls drop down towards the ball-lift.In an interview published in 1982 in The Pinball Collectors' Quarterly, Bally Vice President Herb Jones explained they never could get the mechanics right on the rotating shutter panel, making the alignment of upper and lower holes erratic. Balls would get stuck and not fall through. As a result, he said, almost the entire run of this game was returned to the factory for refund or credit. Thousands of these games were scrapped by Bally, and their cabinets were salvaged to make Bally's 1933 'Mike and Ike'.Of the cabinet examples pictured here, four show ball lifts, all different from each other. The cabinet photos attributed to Higgins show no external ball lift knob, as the lift is built into the ball shooter, where pulling back the shooter lifts the ball up to playing level. The cabinet photos attributed to Lankar show a round wooden knob on its right side, and the playfield sticker advises the player to turn this knob to 'release' balls. We are not certain if this knob releases balls to the ball shooter, or if it is used at the very start of play to drop all balls through the playfield holes as a solution to any problems encountered when the coin slide did it. The cabinet photos attributed to Ricci show a metal lever on the front, below the shooter knob, to lift the balls up. This third game also had extensive reconstruction inside, replacing metal with wood and vice versa, clearly not by the factory, so its ball lift style may not be original either. The cabinet photos attributed to Dodel show a metal ball lift knob on the side.A Billboard article dated July 30, 1932 mentions a report from Bally President Ray Maloney that Ballyround had been \"greatly improved\" but does not elaborate. We know games with the combined lift-and-shooter were advertised in May of 1932. We would think the great improvement was with the troublesome baffle board. The fourth cabinet shown here appears to have all original internal construction. We have no pictures of the inside of the first two cabinet styles to evaluate further."

		"notes": "Roger Sharpe tells us that he and Steve Epstein designed this game and Barry Oursler built up the whitewood based on Roger's mylar layout.We have heard more than one story about the renaming of this game, causing the atypical placement of two alphabet letters on a single playfield insert. Pinball designer/programmer Larry Demar stated in an interview that the original name of the game was 'Las Vegas', eventually becoming 'Jet Orbit'. Artist Doug Watson told us that the name changed again when he created the art. Inspired by Swiss artist H.R. Giger, Doug drew a predatory fish morphing into a model's head \"against a landcape of teeth\", and he named her 'Barracuda'. He presented his drawing to Mike Stroll, President of Williams, who liked the art but felt the name 'Barracuda' had negative connotations. Mike and a few other people who were present were starting to think of an alternate name on the spot. Doug quickly suggested 'Barracora' as the woman's name, and Mike loved it. Doug proceeded to discreetly make naked 'Barracoras' on the playfield.Compare the backglass art to H.R. Giger's painting, \"Li I\". Information about the artwork can be found here."

The owner obtained the game in 1999 from northern New York from a collector who bought games in that general area. The machine was coined 2/25c and 3 balls per play. To assist any forensic study of this game, we offer several pictures along with some of the information given by the owner:The cabinet: The colors look the same as other games. He repainted the backbox as well as the entire front of the cabinet. He touched up the cabinet sides with paint and then waxed.The playfield: The yellow targets (four in middle and two at top) are translucent except the target marked '12' is opaque and came from a 'Beat Time' parts machine. The pop bumpers had gray wood-grain protectors that he replaced with smaller clear ones. Removing the old protectors revealed a lime-green color underneath. He states the picture(s) really bring out the contrast between this blue and green but to the eye it is not so extreme.The backglass: The owner touched up a few small specks in the jackets of the people, a few thin lines in the snare drum, and coated the match numbers with a watered-down backing color.The serial number: The serial number on the front of the cabinet was gouged up and barely readable, and his repaint of the entire front now covers it completely. The number on the paper card on the upper apron has long since faded away. The only apparent serial number remaining is located inside the backbox as #90909. Compared to the range of serial numbers reported to the Internet Pinball Serial Number Database, #90909 is very low in the production run for 'Beat Time' but not the lowest number they have.In summary, while color fade may be an arguable point for either playfield or backglass, it doesn't account for all the color differences that are present. For instance, the girl's red hair in the area overlapping the bass drum could not be the result of fade. We believe serial number #90909 makes this an example of an Early Production game, and we have marked the images accordingly.Backglasses that show the name 'The Beatles' instead of 'The Bootles' are fully new backglasses, or modified factory glasses, both not original to production."

		"notes": "In the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1, author Dick Bueschel writes that movie theaters, in order to increase attendance during the Great Depression, would give gifts to patrons or would draw for prizes using the numbers on the ticket stubs. In 1936, 'Bank Night' was started, which was a cash giveaway of five to twenty dollars to the lucky patron with the matching ticket stub numbers, but the winner had to be present to collect, otherwise the amount would increase for the next show.This pinball machine carried the same theme, as shown on the backglass and the playfield holes. The Register holes represented buying the movie ticket, the Winning Number holes compared to matching the ticket stub, and scoring a Player Present hole was necessary to collect the prize. Lights on the backglass reflect when each of these three functions was achieved. Artwork in the lower playfield shows patrons up on stage in front of the spinning cage used to draw the winning tickets.There are two ways to win:1) Scoring 4 holes in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the upper playfield grid.2) Scoring one of the two Register holes, both Winning Number holes, and either of the Player Present holes would award the player the value shown on the lower playfield Bank Dial. If no win, then the Bank Dial would increment as a carry-over feature to the next game until it was won. This dial also increased every time the Bank Increases hole was made.This game is not equipped with a payout mechanism, but payouts would be made by the location if the backglass showed the Register, Winning Number, and Player Present components were achieved. The payout would range from 50 cents to $2.50.Bueschel also writes that this game has slanted woodrails, not only for appearances' sake but to prevent the parking of cigarettes on it. He seems to suggest that either Rock-Ola was the first manufacturer to do this, or this was their first game to have this."

		"notes": "For several Williams games (especially before 1987), Speech Processing was a separate task than Software Programming and may have been done by a different person than whom we list as having done the Software. Paul Dussault did the English Speech Processing for this game.Black Knight' introduced 'Magna-Save' and the Bonus Ball concept where the player with the highest score won additional seconds of free play. Magna-Save was a feature where a user could press a button on either side and magnets would prevent the ball from draining via that outlane. It would stop and hold the ball and drop it into the inlane. The user had to perform some task to re-enable magnasave.Steve Ritchie confirmed his voice was used on this game.Comments from designer Steve Ritchie:Black Knight was the first game ever to employ faceted inserts (the transparent inlaid plastic windows) in the playfield. My design was a simple eight-sided \"Jewel Look\", but insert texturing progressed from there to many different designs, finally settling on refracting radial lines originating at the center of round and rectangular inserts and from points of arrows and lightning bolts, etc.In the beginning of the production run, the transformer was located in the backbox, and the game used power supply board part# D-7999, with a stand-alone General Illumination Relay mounted to the backbox floor. During production, the transformer was moved to the lower cabinet and the G.I. Relay was then mounted on a new power supply board, part# D-8345.Pictured in this listing is the inside backbox of an Early Production game having System 7 boards in it, except for the power supply board which is System 6. The serial number of the game is 460804 and the playfield has \"Dec 2 1980\" on it. Reportedly, several more games with System 6 power supplies have been sighted in Germany and they likely are also Early Production, but no serial numbers for them have been identified to us.From France, we have a picture of the inside lower cabinet for an Early Production game having serial number 458205 and the owner states it has a regular System 6 Power board. This picture shows a board upon which rests the line filter and the main power fuse. The transformer, normally found on this board in later games in the production run, is located in the backbox.Also pictured in this listing is a Pre-Production backglass owned for many years by Steve Ritchie. The knight's armor is a teal color, not gray like in production glasses. Only one was made. The current owner states this glass is a lot thinner than regular backglasses, and that artist Tony Ramunni's signature on it is different.Also pictured in this listing is a stripped playfield from the game with serial number 457797. Three of the four slots cut into this playfield for the drop target banks also have a cutout to support a vertical rebound switch. The switch can be seen in the flyer game if one looks carefully at the center drop bank. We do not know how many production games had these switches. Games that do not have switches might still have the playfield cutouts. Other games might not even have the cut outs. Steve Ritchie explains:The switch was removed because it never really got a chance to be hit much.  The timers would reset the banks, so they weren't exposed often enough to justify the cost of keeping them.'Black Knight' was the first solid state game with a multi-level playfield. Examples of earlier games with multi-level playfields are Fisher & Coe Manufacturing Company's 1933 'Grand Central' and Chicago Vending Company's 1934 'Three Point'."

Stephanie Rogers and Glo Van Vlack are the voices of the Choir of Angels.We asked Steve about an image in this listing showing a sticker affixed to the upper playfield back wall advertising the sale of BK T-shirts. He replies:The sticker is authentic.  It was printed and attached to later games on the back panel, but most were removed by owners and operators.  The same message is basically presented in the dmd at different times during the attract mode, but someone in marketing said \"What if the game is turned off?\"  and, \"It is good to point out the free T-shirt feature to operators and players.\" The sticker had low intensity adhesive and was easily peeled off without leaving marks.",

Advertised as 42 inches long by 22 inches wide. Battery-powered.",
		"notes": "This may be the first pinball machine designed with bumpers. Each bowling pin bumper has a long, thin rod attached and is mounted via a coil spring so that movement in any direction may be achieved. The Bolo bumper was developed by W. VonStoeser and was a prototype of the passive bumper found on pinball machines that followed.According to Dick Bueschel's Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2 , production of this game initially was jobbed out to suppliers all around Utica, New York, who not only made the components but assembled the games. These first games were non-payout and were introduced in Billboard magazine in July 1936. In September, Pacent leased a new, larger location and began making the games themselves under one roof. In December 1936, they began making Payout and Ticket versions. Demand for these games was so great that production could not keep up, and backorders grew. Bally President Ray Maloney, who had been looking for the next great idea, seized the opportunity and swiped the bumper concept from Bolo, improved it, patented the improvement, and began making Bally's 1936 'Bumper'. In a 1985 telephone interview, it was former New York operator Johnny Belotta who told Bueschel that Maloney swiped the bumper idea from Bolo and that nothing about it was published in the media at the time. The demand shifted to Bally's game from all directions at the same time that interest in Bolo had waned. Pacent filed for bankruptcy by mid-1937.In 1960, inventor and pinball designer Harry Mabs contacted Cash Box magazine to state that it was he who invented the bumper, in 1934, on a game he identified as \"Washington\", on location in 1934 in Miami, Florida. He states he sold that game to Ray Maloney who, Mabs said, in turn made Bumper. We have included the magazine editorial where his comments appear. In it, he does not mention who manufactured his game and we infer a small quantity was made, local to the Miami area. Other than this editorial, we have found no information on a game called \"Washington\" to confirm that his invention was in fact a device that interacted with a round pinball and not, say, a coin (such as a coin pusher machine), or if the game was indeed a pinball machine and not an arcade game. Although we are hesitant to imagine from Mabs' comments that he could be inexact in what he conveys, we note that Mabs has also said he made the first game with flippers, which we know is a true statement only if conditions are applied to it. Mabs does not say when he sold his 1934 game to Maloney, and we do not know if Belotta, an operator in upstate New York, would have had knowledge about a game in Miami. Perhaps this Bolo game of July 1936 was not Maloney's sole inspiration for his December 1936 game, Bumper, but certainly a catalyst.The photographs in this listing are of a game that is neither the payout or ticket version."

The three balls are then dumped from the pocket back to the player to shoot again, accompanied by a simulated bombing noise which is a crude hammer inside the machine striking the bottom of cabinet.The Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 2 quotes this info from Automatic Age magazine of January 1936:In BOMBER, Rock-Ola's ingenious sound effects device reproduces the actual sound of a bomb as it hits its target. When the bomb hits, a brilliant flash of light accompanies the explosion!"

In the background, a light shines from the bell tower of Boston's Christ Church. However, Revere didn't start his journey on horseback until after he had left Boston, having been first rowed across the Charles River to Charlestown by associates, and there he borrowed a horse to start his ride. Fellow patriot William Dawes was also dispatched from Boston to Lexington for the same reason as was Revere, but Dawes was the one who took the land route through Boston. Therefore, history would have the man on horseback in Boston be William Dawes."

		"features": "5 balls for 5 cents. Trap holes (25). Mirrored backglass.Sound: knocker",
		"notes": "This listing represents Bally 'Broadway' Model 535 and previously carried an incorrect name of 42nd and Broadway. The schematic part number is W-348c showing an issue date of 1951.The earliest Billboard ad that we found for this game (not shown here) is a distributor ad dated Sept-1-1951 page 85 and it referred to this game as \"new\". We have not found any ads placed by the manufacturer.The pictures in this listing show that Bally's six-card Bright Lights bingo game from April 1951 was reused to make this one-card game by mounting in the backbox the light board for a single large bingo card directly onto the front of the insert of that earlier game, covering its six smaller cards. Several stepper units in the backbox for multiple card operation have been manually disabled. The backbox itself is deeper in size when compared to Bright Lights, probably to accommodate the extra space required behind the backglass for the added light board. The underside of the playfield is tagged 'Bright Lights' and the playfield art design is the same. The cabinet art is the same, however the paint lines on the coin door do not fully coincide with those of the cabinet. This coin door is further different, having a start button and a coin chute instead of a coin slide, and may be a repainted after-factory replacement. The schematic that came with the game is also pictured here and carries a part number found in Bally documentation assigned to Model 535. This schematic clearly shows it is a replay game with a replay counter. However, in the game pictured here, a portion of the backbox unit that searches for winning score combinations has been removed from the game, leaving clipped wires. This means no replays are ever awarded in spite of the score cards that were included with the game, and the knocker never operates. As a result, this particular game operates as a 5-ball novelty game, even while its inoperative replay unit remains visible to the player. It seems excessive to have physically deconstructed the search unit in this way when unsoldering wires would have been simpler and easily reversible, but perhaps it was necessary to show local authorities on demand that this game could never award replays. Reportedly, several of these games were operated in the Syracuse, New York area where replays were illegal. Perhaps the different coin door was necessary for New York operation. We don't know how many units of this Model 535 were made, and since the game pictured here reportedly is the only example that anyone has found, we do not know if other examples would have the unusual backbox insert modification. Even so, we have no reason to believe this modification and deeper backbox were not produced by Bally. The mirrored backglass is an original design and does carry the brand name. We suggest that any unauthorized party making a backglass would not have risked using the brand name or have bothered with the added expense of mirroring.Interestingly, although the schematic defends Broadway as a replay game, Bally's internal documentation identifies Model 535 as a \"5-ball novelty\" while clearly listing other machines of this type as \"bingo\". It is hard to know what Bally was thinking, when we find no ads placed by them, and the old Billboard ads we do find are minimal notices placed by distributors located in Los Angeles and other territories where replays were legal. The score cards imply a replay unit payoff, but could also be used in restricted territories to direct the location to pay off the player when law enforcement was not looking.Bright Lights and Broadway were Bally's first two bingo machines following a gap of many years since their very first one in 1937, Line-Up. Bally later made a different bingo game with the same name and a different backglass. See Bally's 1955 'Broadway'."

We have numbered the images of these games to correspond with their descriptions:#1) Green and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are green (or blue) and the three unlettered bumper caps are red (or pink). A red pop bumper and flippers were added after the game left the factory. The cabinet art looks repainted.#2) Orange and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are orange. The three unlettered bumper caps are purplish. No after-factory modifications are apparent. The cabinet art looks factory-quality.#3) Another orange and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are orange. On the lower playfield, the center bumper is purple while the bumpers on each side of it were replaced with red pop bumpers. Flippers were retrofitted as well, although the right flipper is missing and only its post hole is evident. The cabinet has been repainted.Setting aside the obvious after-factory modifications, both playfield color versions appear to be factory-quality. Unfortunately, we find only black-and-white advertisements from the manufacturer to assist our understanding of this.None of the cabinet art match the game in the Billboard ad. More examples of the cabinet are needed (or more 1940's ads) to study if multiple cabinet art designs could have been produced by the manufacturer. Although one or more of the cabinets presented here are repainted, we include them in this listing in order to anticipate any user questions about it, as we continue to gather additional information about this game."

Within each ring is a large diameter rubbered post of like color that does not spin, move, or score points, but does light up. There is a sixteenth spring bumper (yellow) at the bottom of the playfield.Pushing in the coin chute starts the game and lights up all bumpers. Pulling the chute back out leaves only the three center posts illuminated and all balls are then released to the ball lift mechanism. A ball hitting an unlit bumper scores 20 points. When the score reaches 760 points, the yellow ring of five bumpers will all light. Reaching 960 points will light the green ring of five, and reaching 1060 points will light the red ring of five. These bumpers will stay lit for the remainder of the game. The actual point thresholds to light these rings are operator adjustable. The sole yellow bumper at the bottom of the playfield can only be lit if a ball exits the playfield via the bottom rollover when the score is exactly 600 points. A ball hitting a lit bumper awards a replay on the backglass. The replays are displayed via silkscreened numbers that are not evident until lit, with numbers 1 to 9 on the left side, and numbers 10 through 70 on the right side. This makes for the possibility that a high number of replays can be awarded. A knockoff button on the right front of the cabinet bottom will subtract the replays down to zero, allowing for location payoffs. This game has a timer to shut off power to the entire machine even if a game is in progress."

The playfield glass is painted underneath with a design that complements the playfield layout, covering areas that are unused in game play. The upper playfield has three kick-out holes, five 500-point trap holes, a 1000-point trough, a 1500-point trough, and an outhole trough. It also has a right-side ball kicker lane and two left-side outlanes (one on each side of the 1500-point trough) to drop the ball to the lower playfield carousel. The carousel has trap holes around its perimeter and steps clockwise in response to upper playfield action. There is an outhole directly below it.A ball landing in the top \"Advance 1000 ball\" kick-out hole steps the carousel one position and kicks one ball out from the 1000-point trough, rolling it below the outball trough to the top hole of the carousel, worth 2000 points.A ball landing in the top \"Advance 1500 ball\" kick-out hole steps the carousel one position and kicks one ball out from the 1500-point trough, rolling it down the long left lane to loop around and land in the bottom hole of the carousel, worth 4500 points. If the top or bottom hole of the carousel is already occupied with a ball, the arriving ball will roll down towards either an outhole below the carousel, ending that ball in play, or fall into the return hole on the looping lane, allowing the player to shoot it again into play.A ball landing in the topmost kick-out hole returns all balls in the upper playfield outhole trough to the player to shoot again.The point values for the holes in the carousel do not move when the carousel moves. As the carousel steps, all balls trapped there step with it, increasing value up to 6500 points, but a ball worth 6500 points can step next to a 2000-point position to start all over.This game is designed to be multiball in the sense that a ball landing in a kick-out hole will be kicked back into play and simultaneously cause another ball to be kicked back into play from one of the upper playfield point troughs.'Builder Upper' was manufactured to be battery-operated, but one example pictured here has since been converted to line power. It has no apparent serial number, and its ball-lift mechanism is a knob on the right side of the cabinet, while the other game pictured here uses a front-loading push rod just below the plunger. No information is available to explain the reason for the two ball-lift versions, but manufacturers were known to make changes during production, sometimes based on operator feedback or because the original version had to be rushed to market."

Bally copied the idea from Pacent Novelty's 1936 'Bolo', a game that came out several months earlier. Bally did change the bumper design enough to obtain a patent on it.Patent No. 2,109,678 (\"CONTACT SWITCH FOR BALL ROLLING GAMES\") application was made on January 12, 1937 after the game was already in full production, and issued March 1, 1938 to Nils A. Nelson, a staff draftsman.According to interviews recorded in the  Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, inventor Donald E. Hooker did the work of inventing the Bally bumper while Nils Nelson got the credit.'Bumper' used an electrical progressive score unit in the backbox which kept a running total using light projection. This was an improvement over previous pinball machines where the player had to add up the score by counting balls on the playfield. The new bumper allowed balls to exit the playfield after play while the score was maintained on the backbox.An earlier game having a mechanical progressive score unit is Gottlieb's 1934 'Register'.Patent No. 1,802,521 (\"GAME APPARATUS\") was filed Aug 14, 1928 and issued April 28, 1931 to George H.

According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, Ken Shyvers soon negotiated with Frank Koehler to obtain the rights to produce that game as his own game, Cannon Fire. When imitations showed up from competitors. Shyvers vigorously pursued protecting his rights. For that reason, on October 12, 1935, Kohler filed patent 2,070,948 and Shyvers filed patent 2,087,799 the same day. The two patents have identical drawings but non-identical text.By the time the first of the two patents, Koehler's, was approved in February 1937, pinball technology had evolved to render both Cannon Ball and Cannon Fire no longer viable, and Shyvers sold forty percent of his rights to Mr. B.P. Higby of Peoria, Illinois, a collector of patent rights. Due to the legal confusion surrounding ownership, the U.S. Patent Office issued a clarifying report in early 1937 that stated the kicker had a patent Application of August 1934 with a Reapplication in October 12, 1935, and was invented and patented by Frank Koehler of Portland, Oregon and assigned to Ken C. Shyvers of Chicago, Ill.Also produced as Shyvers Coin Automatic Machine Company's 1934 'Cannon Fire Jr.'."

In it, Kelley revealed that his inspiration for the art for 'Capersville' was the 1965 French detective movie 'Alphaville' starring American actor-singer Eddie Constantine. After looking at some old movie posters, it becomes obvious that Constantine is the man in the backglass."

		"notes": "'Capt. Fantastic' was inspired by the movie 'Tommy' and includes a representation of Elton John, as his character from the movie, playing pinball on the backglass. Tom Nieman, VP of Marketing for Bally Pinball, tells us the flyer was made while Elton was recording a new album in Canada. For this flyer, a game was shipped to the Toronto hotel where Elton was staying. That is why he is shown wearing a Canadian hockey jersey. Elton then asked Nieman to send a game to his various residences and one to his \"mum\" in the UK.Artist Dave Christensen included in the backglass several depictions of people doing things that, at first, escaped notice by Bally management. A small number of games with these so-called \"X-rated\" or \"uncensored\" backglasses made it through production before changes were required to be made. Specifically, small mirrored stars were added over the objectionable parts and, curiously, these stars did not effectively obscure the offending art in all instances. Nieman explained to us that he and Christensen wanted the correction to be as minimal as possible because they knew they had \"a monster hit\" on their hands. The X-rated version is often referred to as the \"no stars\" version even though all of the backglasses in the production run did contain a certain number of peripheral decorative stars anyway. Nieman is depicted in the backglass as the man in the three-piece suit, and he says that 'Brutus' is artist Paul Faris.Mr. Nieman attended the 1975 New York premier party for the movie \"Tommy\" held in the 57th Street subway station. He had agreed with artist Christensen to represent the date of this event in the backglass art as the score 31775. A biography of Keith Moon records the date of this party as March 18, 1975. It is easy to believe that the party extended over both days.Bally made an unknown quantity of playfields for this game having orange star rollover inserts instead of the usual green ones. This version is seldom seen, which indicates the quantity made was small. Pictured in this listing are three different examples of this \"orange version\" playfield. Two of the three also have a white drop target Special insert, instead of the expected red-colored one. The production run of this game was over 16,000 units, and these \"orange version\" playfields may have simply resulted from spot shortages during the production run of playfield parts having the correct colors. More information is needed to understand the reason for these playfield differences.The Early Production game pictured here has serial number 1088 and has green star rollover inserts on its playfield. It has the Over The Top backglass which is uncensored and, like the game in the flyer, its cabinet front has the \"reversed\" red and blue striping as compared to the striping on the cabinet sides.Included in this listing is a playfield showing signatures of both the designer and artist silkscreened in the black area at the bottom where the outlanes exit towards the outhole. Greg Kmiec tells us that Christensen had sneaked their signatures there but when Bally management heard about it and saw it, they made Christensen remove the signatures. Greg initially stated that only ten playfields were produced like this in a pilot run, not to appear on production games, but when the production game with serial number 1087 was identified as having a signed playfield, it caused him to wonder if a larger quantity of, say, 100 was actually made, to have appeared on production games. Another explanation would be that game 1087 was retrofitted with a pilot run playfield after it left the factory. We note that the game with serial number 1088 does not have a signed playfield.One game in this listing has a backbox frame painted red instead of the usual white. We have no further information on this except the same variation has been seen on Bally's 1978 'Power Play'.A home version of this game was also produced; see Bally's 1977 'Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy'."

This first ball leaving playfield operates a \"Switch\" rollover which means all remaining balls will increase the score on the right side of backglass in 100-point increments. Replays are awarded for getting the right-side score to meet or beat the left-side score. In effect, the first ball sets the replay threshold for the remaining four balls. The 1000-point rollovers increase the right-side score by that amount with any ball in play, including the first one.To prevent a cheating player from shooting a second ball into play before the first ball has exited the playfield, the ball-lift mechanism has a contact on it to activate the \"Switch\" rollover if the player lifts a second ball prematurely.The single replay threshold will award either 2,3,4,5, or 10 replays.

Historian Sam Harvey�s handwritten notes credits three additional people as co-designers: Wayne Neyens, Bob Smith, and Tony Girardo. However, we found Patent 3,675,927 listing four inventors, Alvin Gottlieb, Wayne Neyens, Bob Smith, and Doc Garbark. We contacted Wayne Neyens, who had had the original concept for this game, and he explained how the game ended up being designed by committee, to his dismay:Tony GERARD was our superintendent, he was in charge of everything. Tony became ill and had to leave the company (he passed away shortly after) and Bob Smith became the superintendent and I became the Chief Engineer, We were very fortunate that Ed Krynski had joined the company and so he became the designer. I am not sure of the date that this all happened. It would sure help if I could come up with that date. Challenger must have been in the designing process for some time, I remember Bob, Alvin, Doc, and myself all arguing over the game, how that game ever got built I'll never know. I think Ed had very little if anything to do with Challenger, he was busy with designing our regular games. That period of time with Tony becoming Ill, Bob moving into his job, me moving into the engineering room and Ed coming on board was a very difficult time for all of us. No wonder there is so much confusion concerning the names on the Patent, etc. The earliest of our Gottlieb Engineering Game Cards shows Challenger was in the Engineering Department in August 1970 and by October 1970 had moved into production. Until we find information to support the retention of Krynski�s name as designer, Wayne agreed it is fair to remove Krynski�s name and replace it with the four names shown on the patent.  Patent 3,675,927 [TWO-PLAYER PINBALL MACHINE] filed June 10, 1970. Granted July 11, 1972 to Alvin J Gottlieb, Wayne E Neyens, Robert T Smith, and Roman F Garbark, Inventors."

A bell rings when the ball is shot to the high score area. No outhole on this game: two kickback lanes, in lower left and lower right of playfield, propel wayward balls back into scoring areas until they land in score pockets.This italicized information was taken from an advertisement:Chicago Express is the zipping, thrilling, most fascinating game in pin game history. Read carefully the ACTION the ball creates for the player:1. Player aims at and shoots ball into 1st top electric elevator, lighting up green go-ahead signal.2. Ball is elevated instantly and switched onto upper level tracks towards and into the 2nd or bottom electric elevator.3. As the ball in the 2nd elevator is being lifted and switched to next track, the whole train lights up and all the balls in the bottom Express Stations are automatically and simultaneously advanced into the next higher score stations.4. When a ball reaches the last Express Station, it is automatically shunted up the board and into the enclosed high score depot.Just imagine the novelty of seeing the balls elevated and sent down the tracks for a fast, thrilling ride. The flashing lights. The simultaneous advance and the speediest shooting ever incorporated into one pin game. That's the CHICAGO EXPRESS -- America's Newest Pin Game Thrill!",

		"notes": "Designer George Gomez tells us about his original design for this game and of changes that were made prior to production:At the time Williams was making wide bodies and so my design began as a widebody, but it didn't get very far. No widebody whitewoods were ever built. I originally designed the game with drop targets and the code for this is still in the game. The decals said B-2-K which was the Callaway Turbo option. A 4-Speed shifter was bolted to the side of the game and was used to shift gears in the dragstrip mode. That code also is still there. Some of the prototypes were built with these features and somewhere I have photos. Numerous prototypes were built with the shifters and also I retrofitted one onto a production game. Numerous switches (ramp ends), flashers, and lights were removed, along with the targets and shifter, to get the game within the bill of materials budgets.Pictured in this listing is an example of the so-called \"NCM\" games, made for the National Corvette Museum located in Bowling Green, Kentucky. We were unable to reach Tom Uban for input about them, but designer George Gomez provided this information:Museum games were very early production games. They were not prototypes. The playfield that you refer to in the image is one of the 17 prototype games, several of these playfields went to the museum for display purposes. However, museum games did have the special NCM welcome message in the code, this may have been the only difference in those games, other than that they were very early in the production run. I personally sold Chip Miller his game. At the time he was one of the key guys in the ZR1 registry and many of those guys bought games from us at the museum. I don�t remember the exact number of games that we took to the museum. I believe it was either 6 or 9. One went into the gift shop where I believe it still resides. I set up displays on the design of the game including drawings, the prototype playfields, and many other development items such as models within the museum. One was in the display cases at the base of the Spire, the other was in a hallway display case near the Corvette toys exhibit in the museum.During the grand opening weekend celebration the games were operated 24 hours a day at dollar play to benefit a charity. I worked the games with some of the other members of my team promoting and exposing people to the game. With me were Tom Kopera, mechanical engineer on the game; Bill Grupp, software engineer assisting Tom Uban; Roger Sharpe, director of licensing; and Barb Rosenthal, the Bally-Williams marketing director.If memory serves, I took 3 prototype playfields with me to the museum for the grand opening. The playfields were left in the care of the museum's curators. I was disappointed to learn that somehow they were let go from the museum's collection. Someone in Bowling Green ended up with one of them, he tells me that he bought it from a museum employee.",

		"notes": "A special version was produced for Germany with the same project number and project release date.  The schematic part number for the US version was W-1042-56a.  The German version was W-1042-57a.There were two different early production types using blue and/or black cabinet colors instead of the usual white production colors.  This can be seen in the flyer.The geometric cabinet design was used again on Bally's 1969 'On Beam' although the colors were changed.Included in this listing are three images from an owner who states they are from his German version of �Cosmos� with serial number 1638. One image shows the knocker coil assembly, mounted below the right flipper button, has no wires leading to it. Another image shows inside the backbox where the bell and coil are missing, and only the two drilled holes are visible in the cabinet wall for them, showing no evidence of use. The owner saw no factory wiring present in the game cabling for these two sound-making devices, and no loose or clipped wires to indicate a field removal had occurred. We contacted a long-time collector in Germany who confidently asserted that Germany had no laws or local ordinances prohibiting sound in pinball machines but that, according to a discussion he had had with an employee from L�wen-Automaten, the company that imported Bally machines at the time, operators simply didn't use the bells and so the pinball companies decided together that they could save costs by not shipping them. A collector in Austria whom we contacted has Gottlieb games from the 1970�s without the chime units in them, but all of his 1960�s Bally games do have their bells in the backbox, including his German versions.Neither of these collectors had heard of any laws ever prohibiting sound in pinball machines in Germany, a theory of which we had lightly heard but also for which we have received no supporting information. We welcome additional input on this topic."

A shelf with cigarette holder allowed for placement of drinks and increased the length by six inches. The plywood bottom was increased from 1/4-inch to 3/4 inch in thickness. Williams used this cabinet design on several games during 1960-1961.",
		"notes": "Some Early Production games were made in a standard woodrail cabinet.The Billboard articles pictured in this listing explain the introduction of this new cabinet to selected distributors and also explain some benefits of its features.Some pinball resources show Steve Kordek as the designer for this game, as we once did. In an article appearing in The Pinball Compendium 1930s-1960s, Kordek stated that his first game at Williams was a rifle game, 'Space Glider' in 1960. His second game was the pinball machine Bo Bo. That information also appears on a list that Steve Kordek composed in the late 1990's (or so) of all the games that he designed while at Williams. 'Darts' was not on that list."
