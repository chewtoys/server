  Events are read-only entries describing what's going on on the site. They are
  a good way to keep users updated about their favorite games or releases or
  just to give an overall impression of the site's activity.

  Every event is linked to the person who triggered it (the `actor`). The
  structure of the `payload`, i.e. the actual event data, depends on the event
  type (`event`).

  For resource-specific events, see:

    - [`/user/events`](api://core/get/user/events) - Events for currenty logged user
    - [`/games/{game_id}/events`](api://core/get/games/{game_id}/events) - Events for a given game
    - [`/releases/{release_id}/events`](api://core/get/releases/{release_id}/events) - Events for a given release
