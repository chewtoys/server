  "notes": "This game has the same playfield layout and cabinet art as Maresa's '300' but the backglass art is different. We don't know what differences may exist between them. Both are copies of the 4-player Gottlieb's 1975 '\"300\"'. Both are replay games. Due to restrictions on foreign imports to Spain, pinball machines could not be imported from the U.S., but whether this game is a licensed copy or an illegal reproduction is unknown.",
