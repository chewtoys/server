  "manufacturer": "Gottlieb",
  "model_number": "671",
  "year": 1982,
  "game_type": "ss",
  "produced_units": 193,
  "features": "Flippers (4), Pop bumpers (4), Slingshots (2), Standup targets (8), Kick-out holes (2), 5-bank drop targets (1), 4-bank drop targets (1), 3-bank drop targets (1), Kicking target (1), Spinning target (1).Same playfield layout as Gottlieb's 1981 'Black Hole' but without the lower level playfield.  What would be the entrance to the lower level on Black Hole is a captive hole for multiball on Eclipse. Achieving multiball requires specific targets to be achieved in sequence.",
  "notes": "Although only 193 complete games were produced, a considerable number of kits (comprising a backglass, playfield and game ROMs) were produced. These kits were usually used to convert \"James Bond 007\" cabinets.  Eclipse uses the same sound PROM as the export version of Black Hole.",
