  "game_type": "em",
  "features": "1 cent play. Backglass light animation and synthesized sound. A ball skillfully landing in the \"trigger hole\" caused backglass flashing lights to highlight the hunter whose rifle shot is then heard (caused by a dashpot snapped by a magnet). Measures 39 1/2 long, 19 1/2 inches wide, and 9 1/2 inches high. Powered by a dry cell battery.",
  "notes": "This is the first game with \"synthesized\" sound, described in US Patent No. 2,103,870 applied for August 23, 1935 and patented December 28, 1937 (David C. Rockola, assigned to Rock-Old Mfg. Corp.). It was seen as a gimmick and was soon dropped from Rock-Ola's games.",
